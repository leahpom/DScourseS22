\section{Problem 3}

My data is a table of the record holders for shortest women in the world. I chose it because it struck my fancy. I'm unlikely to use this specific data set, but I can see a future where I dabble in looking at how physical characteristics affect perception and how perception affects labor market outcomes (like how more attractive people are more likely to get jobs). 

\section{Problem 4}

My data is the value of Ethereum cryptocurrency. Like most people, I'm really not a fan of crypto, but I'm doing some research on NFTs with Dr. Kosmopoulou, and many NFT transactions use the Ethereum blockchain and are paid for with Ethereum. This data is useful for converting the prices of NFTs from a transaction to the dollar value. I used the fredr package in R.
